Notice: The class ArosArm contains codes, including the Differential kinematics and Virtual Elastic System
ArmThread contains the definition of tasks
In the dialog PHRI, there are two main function needs to notice: 
+When the button Execute is pressed, the thread ArmThread will be called to execute the respective task
+When the vision is connected, the function UpdateVision will reun by timer to update new coordinate of object such as obstacle, green target and/or green handle

//--------------Tracking and grasping
1)Start the arm at a confortable position, for instance: 
	Go to (Use Roll Pitch Yaw description):
	Xe: 900    	Yaw: 0
	Ye: -500	Pitch:0
	Ze: -200	Roll: 0
2) Connect to module : 
Hand
Vision
3)Select the respective task and press "Execute" button.
4) The robot will begin to track the green target when it sees the object.
//--------------Draw ellipse
1)Start the arm at a confortable position which give the desired ellipse in the workspace, for instance: 
	Go to (Use Roll Pitch Yaw description):
	Xe: 800    	Yaw: 0
	Ye: -500	Pitch:0
	Ze: -200	Roll: -90
2) Connect to module : 
Vision (Optional)
3)Select the respective task and press "Execute" button.

//--------------Interaction
1)Start the arm at a confortable position, for instance: 
	Go to (Use Roll Pitch Yaw description):
	Xe: 800    	Yaw: 0
	Ye: -500	Pitch:0
	Ze: -200	Roll: -90
2) Connect to module : 
Hand
Speech (Optional)
Vision (Optional)
3)Select the respective task and press "Execute" button.
4)Give the robot an object to grasp and move the robotic hand as you wish

//--------------Take me around
1)Start the arm at the home position or a confortable position, for instance: 
	Go to (Use Roll Pitch Yaw description):
	Xe: 900    	Yaw:0
	Ye:-500		Pitch:0
	Ze:200		Roll: -90
2) Connect to module : 
Mobile Platform (Must) 
Laser (Optional. if want to avoid ground obstacle. If not connect, the robot will not avoid)
Speech (Optional)
Vision (Optional)
Hand(Optional)
3)Select the respective task and press "Execute" button.
4)Now the robot can be taken to go around.

//--------------Transportation task
Like the task "Take me around", take him to the object and lower the hand so that the robot knows that he reaches to the target object.
